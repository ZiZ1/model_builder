Software for doing multiscale modeling in Dr. Cecilia Clementi's research group
at Rice University. 

Purpose:
--------
    The purpose of this software is to make multiscale, combining coarse-grain
and all-atom approaches, modeling easier. The intention is that model_builder
will become a useful toolset for Clementi group members. It is intended to be
used with a complementary module, project_tools, which runs simulations and
performs parameter fitting. 

    The model_builder package is responsible for constructing simulation input
files (e.g. Gromacs .gro and .top files) for (currently) coarse-grain models
of proteins.
