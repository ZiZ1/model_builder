---------------------------- ModelBuilder --------------------------------
Created: November 2013
Author: Alexander Kluber

Created in 2013 for doing structure-based modeling (and other variations) in
Dr. Cecilia Clementi's research group at Rice University. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
    The purpose of the ModelBuilder module is to serve as a top-level
simulation handler for starting structure-based model simulations. Most of
the actual data of the simulation is stored in the Model and System objects
(see model.py system.py for more information). The ModelBuilder class
handles these objects so that most of the details are compartamentalized and
out of sight.
    At the top-level of a project we are concerned with large conceptual
tasks, such as determining the folding temperature. Of course many smaller
steps are required to acheive this task, but if there is a robust method in
place for these smaller tasks then we don't need to deal with the details.
Breaking down our tasks into conceptual steps is ideal for coding classes
that are intuitive. The goal is that the names of the classes, functions,
and variables will reflect this organizational logic and be
self-documenting. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
    ModelBuilder works with two data structures: Model and System. 
ModelBuilder only needs a PDB file and some command line options to prepare
and initialize simulation.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
How To Use this Module:
    ModelBuilder depends on Gromacs and python (also many non-standard
python modules).
